# piiom-tool library
Pixel Image Input, Output &amp; Memory tool library.

!!! Warning !!! At this time this repository is just a placeholder and contains no useful code or at most some testcases. !!! warning !!!

This tool library is specifically for pixel based file and memory formats and contains methods for reading from files, writing to files, structured memory dumping, structured memory manipulation, conversion to and from an extended raw format and analysis tools.  It is not intended as a graphics library in the sense of various filters, rotations and manipulations.  The purpose is to enable basic reading and writing of image files so that a target software can focus on its own target features.  It is our hope that piiom-tool library can be easily dropin / plugin for other projects.
